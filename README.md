Too lazy to go to the store? Don't have a car? Live in Alaska? Find what you can cook using ingredients you have at hand. Lazy_Chef lets you know what's possible with what you already have in the fridge or pantry.

## Technologies/Frameworks used

RoR (React as the front and Rails on the back).

Uses react-router and props drilling amongst stateful components. Consumes a 3rd party recipe API provided by [Spoonacular](https://spoonacular.com/). All custom CSS as no UI framework could achieve its unique look.

The CRUD app integrates with a backend RESTful API built with Rails. Features Authentication/Authorization together with the browser using JSON Web Tokens. Repo can be found here: [lazy_Chef_API](https://github.com/Abdul-Sayed/lazy_Chef_API)
